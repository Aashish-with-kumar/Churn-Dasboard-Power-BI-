## Explain churn dashboard

Churn Dashboard Analysis

This dashboard focuses on analyzing customer churn (i.e., customers leaving the service). Each section is explained in detail to provide insights into factors influencing churn. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the dashboard to help you understand key patterns and areas for improvement.


---

1. Customer at Risk

Total customers at risk of churn: 7043.

This indicates that churn is a significant issue for the organization and needs to be addressed.



---

2. Tickets and Charges

No. of Tech Tickets: 2955

These tickets reflect the technical issues customers face, which can be a major reason for churn.


No. of Admin Tickets: 3632

Administrative problems (e.g., billing errors or contract misunderstandings) also contribute to customer dissatisfaction.


Yearly Charges: 16.06M

High annual revenue indicates valuable customers, but high churn could significantly impact it.


Monthly Charges: 456.12K

Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn, as pricing dissatisfaction can be a key factor.

3. Demographics Analysis

(a) Gender Count:

The gender distribution between males and females appears balanced, suggesting that churn is not biased toward one gender.


(b) Senior Citizens:

6.758% of customers are senior citizens.

This group may face challenges in adopting technology, contributing to churn.


(c) Dependents:

17% of customers are dependents (relying on family members).

This group shows a relatively low churn rate, possibly because they prefer stable contracts.


(d) Subscription Time:

The highest churn occurs among customers with subscriptions of <1 year.

Early-stage churn highlights the need to improve the onboarding process and initial customer experience.

Longer subscription durations correlate with reduced churn rates.

4. Customer Account Information

(a) Payment Methods:

Most customers use Electronic Check, which may be associated with higher churn rates.

Customers opting for paperless billing account for 59.22%, indicating a preference for convenience.


(b) Contract Types:

Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn.

Solution: Promote long-term contracts (e.g., 1-year or 2-year plans) to reduce churn.



---

5. Services Customers Signed Up For

(a) Online Backup & Security Services:

Only 28% of customers use online backup, and 16% use online security services.

Promoting these services could increase revenue and reduce churn.


(b) Phone Services:

91% of customers use phone services, which is a strong point. Ensuring the quality of this service is crucial.


(c) Internet Service Types:

Fiber Optic: 43.96% (potentially prone to higher churn due to higher costs).

DSL: 34.37%

Optimizing the balance between pricing and quality for fiber optic services is essential.
